            <h3>Email in, SMS out</h3>
            <p>
              Point alerting systems at a dedicated email address. Alert Bridge
              receives the message, applies your routing rules, and delivers
              compact SMS notifications to the right recipients or groups.

            <h3>Route by address and group</h3>
            <p>
              Use intuitive routes to map inbound email addresses to on-call
              groups, campuses, or escalation paths. You stay in control of who
              gets notified and when.

              Alert Bridge is built for teams that already rely on email-based
              alerts but need a straightforward bridge into SMS — without
              replacing existing systems or re-architecting critical workflows.
