            <h3>Email in, SMS out</h3>
            <p>
              Point alerting systems at a dedicated email address. Alert Bridge
              receives the message, stores it in your alert log, and sends
              a generic notification and secure link to view details.

            <h3>Route by address and group</h3>
            <p>
              Use intuitive routes to map inbound email addresses to on-call
              groups, campuses, or escalation paths. You stay in control of who
              gets notified and when.

            <h3>Designed for operations work</h3>
            <p>
              Alert Bridge is built for teams that already rely on email-based
              alerts but need a straightforward bridge into SMS — without
              replacing existing systems or re-architecting critical workflows.

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>
          Think of Alert Bridge like a secure “heads-up” for important alerts.
          Your systems send the technical details by email, and Alert Bridge sends a short text
          to let the right people know something needs attention. 
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li><strong>Your system emails an alert</strong> to Alert Bridge.</li>
          <li><strong>Alert Bridge saves it</strong> in your secure alert log.</li>
          <li><strong>Alert Bridge sends a short text</strong> (for example, no more than one message every 10 minutes when new alerts are present) with a link.</li>
          <li><strong>You tap the link and verify your phone</strong> so we know it’s really you.</li>
          <li><strong>You see the full details</strong> in the alert log.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          SMS stays simple and consistent. The detailed alert content stays behind the secure link.
