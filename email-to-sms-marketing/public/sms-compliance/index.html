        <h1>Alert Bridge SMS Program &amp; Opt-In Details</h1>

        <p>
          Alert Bridge is an enterprise notification platform used by organizations to
          deliver operational and facility-related alerts to employees and on-call
          staff via SMS. Alerts are generated by business systems such as building
          management systems, monitoring tools, and IT alerting systems.
        </p>

        <h2>Who Receives SMS Alerts</h2>
        <p>
          SMS alerts are only sent to individuals who have an existing business
          relationship with a subscribing organization. Typical recipients include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employees responsible for facilities, operations, or IT services</li>
          <li>Contractors and vendors engaged by the organization</li>
          <li>On-call staff designated by the organization</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Recipients Are Added (Opt-In)</h2>
        <p>
          Recipients are added to Alert Bridge by authorized administrators within
          their organization. Phone numbers are collected through internal processes
          such as HR systems, IT directories, on-call rosters, or operations tooling.
          Administrators then enter these phone numbers into the Alert Bridge admin
          console to enable SMS alerts. This administrator-managed process serves as
          opt-in for SMS alerts.
        </p>

        <p>
          In addition to this administrator-managed opt-in, recipients may manage
          their own participation in SMS alerts by replying <strong>STOP</strong> to
          opt out of receiving alerts and <strong>START</strong> to resume alerts
          after opting out.
        </p>

        <h2>Example: Administrator Adding an SMS Recipient</h2>
        <p>
          The image below shows a simplified example of how an authorized
          administrator adds a staff member as an SMS recipient in the Alert Bridge
          admin UI.
        </p>

        <h2>Opt-Out and Re-Enable (STOP / START)</h2>
        <p>
          Alert Bridge supports standard SMS opt-out and re-enable keywords. If a
          recipient no longer wishes to receive SMS alerts, they may reply
          <strong>STOP</strong> to any message sent from Alert Bridge. When STOP is
          received, SMS delivery to that phone number is disabled, and the recipient
          receives a confirmation message indicating that alerts have been stopped.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the recipient later wishes to resume receiving alerts, they may reply
          <strong>START</strong>, which re-enables SMS notifications for their number.
          A confirmation message is sent after START is processed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recipients who reply STOP or START do not need to contact their
          administrator in order to change their SMS status, although administrators
          may also disable or re-enable recipients through the Alert Bridge admin
          console in response to internal requests.
        </p>

        <h2>Message Content</h2>
        <p>
          SMS messages sent by Alert Bridge are strictly operational in nature and may
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Alarms or alerts from building management systems</li>
          <li>Fault or status notifications for critical equipment</li>
          <li>Operational notifications that require on-call or facilities response</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Alert Bridge does not send marketing or promotional SMS messages.
