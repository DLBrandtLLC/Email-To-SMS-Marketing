  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how Alert Bridge (“Alert Bridge”, “we”,
    “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information in connection
    with our email-to-SMS alerting service (the “Service”).
  </p>

  <p>
    Alert Bridge is designed to help organizations convert specific inbound
    emails into SMS notifications for their authorized recipients. We
    process certain personal data on behalf of our customers so they can
    deliver time-sensitive alerts to their teams.
  </p>

      names, and optional metadata needed to deliver notifications.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.2 Information processed as part of alerts</h3>
  <p>
    When our Service is used as designed, we process parts of email and SMS
    content to deliver alerts and maintain an audit trail:
  </p>
  <ul>

      <strong>Inbound email details</strong> such as sender address,
      subject, body text (in plain text form), and message identifiers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Outbound SMS details</strong> such as the message text,
      recipient phone numbers, delivery status, and optional error codes
      from SMS providers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Log metadata</strong> such as timestamps, routing decisions,
      and correlation IDs used to connect inbound messages with resulting
      SMS notifications.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>2.3 Website and service usage data</h3>

      Provide and operate the Service, including converting emails into SMS
      alerts and logging those events.

    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Legal basis for processing</h2>
  <p>
    Our legal basis for processing personal data depends on the context in
    which it is collected and used. In most cases, we process data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To perform a contract with our customers (for example, operating the
      Service as described in our agreements).
    </li>
    <li>
      For our legitimate interests in providing a secure and reliable
      alerting service, where those interests are not overridden by the
      rights and interests of data subjects.
    </li>
    <li>
      To comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, such as
      telecom and messaging rules.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. How we share information</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell personal data. We may share information in the following
    limited circumstances:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>With SMS and communications providers</strong> in order to
      deliver text messages to recipients’ devices.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>With infrastructure and service providers</strong> that help
      us operate the Service (for example, hosting, logging, and email
      services), under appropriate data protection agreements.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>With customer organizations</strong> that control the
      accounts and phone numbers configured in Alert Bridge, as part of
      logs, reporting, or account management.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>When required by law</strong> or to protect rights, safety,
      or security, in response to valid legal requests or to enforce our
      Terms and Conditions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
  <p>
    We retain message logs and associated content for periods that support
    our customers’ operational and compliance needs. Retention periods may
    vary by subscription plan or customer configuration.
  </p>
  <p>
    When data is no longer needed for the purposes described in this
    policy, we will take reasonable steps to delete or irreversibly
    anonymize it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Your choices and rights</h2>

  <h3>7.1 Recipients of SMS alerts</h3>
  <p>
    If you receive SMS alerts via Alert Bridge, your relationship is
    primarily with the organization that configured the Service (for
    example, your employer or service provider). That organization
    determines which phone numbers are used and what alerts are sent.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where applicable, SMS messages will include information about how to
    opt out of further alerts (for example, replying with a specific
    keyword). You can also contact the sending organization directly if
    you have questions about why you are receiving alerts.
  </p>

  <h3>7.2 Rights under data protection laws</h3>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, you may have rights such as access,
    correction, deletion, or restriction of your personal data. For
    data processed on behalf of a customer, we may redirect your request
    to the relevant customer organization, which acts as the controller of
    that data.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Security</h2>
  <p>
    We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the
    information we process, including access controls, encryption in
    transit where appropriate, and monitoring for unusual activity.
  </p>
  <p>
    No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We encourage
    customers to follow best practices for account security, including
    strong authentication and role-based access to administrative tools.
  </p>

  <h2>9. International transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Alert Bridge may use infrastructure or service providers located in
    different countries. Where personal data is transferred across borders,
    we will take appropriate steps to protect it in accordance with
    applicable law and this policy.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>
   We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes
   in our Service, legal requirements, or business practices. When we do,
   we will update the “Last updated” date above. If changes are material,
   we may provide additional notice through the Service or via email to
   customer contacts.
