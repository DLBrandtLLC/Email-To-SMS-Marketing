  </p>

  <h2>1. The Service</h2>
  <p>
    Alert Bridge allows organizations to route selected inbound emails to

      that messages will not be filtered, delayed, or blocked by carriers
      or recipient devices.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Fees and usage</h2>
  <p>
    If your use of the Service is subject to fees, they will be described

    your use of the Service.

  <p>
    Alert Bridge may maintain logs of inbound emails, outbound SMS
    messages, and related metadata to provide the Service, assist with
    troubleshooting, and meet legal or carrier requirements.
